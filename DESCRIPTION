Description: This package is made by Mario Fernández Sánchez for the
      achievement of his TFG. Whose purpose is to standardize the process of
      prediction of the most likely motif, develop a scoring system
      for each peaks, and determine a threshold to separate the peaks
      potentially functional of those that are not.
